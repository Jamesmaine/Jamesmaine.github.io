## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Hello World, and most likely recruiters /  hiring managers who are here to see if the funny link on my resume lead anywhere.

What you're seeing now is the placeholder whilst I tweak some of the projects I'm currently working on. I have a cache of wine data I scraped and I'm not afraid to use it.

When I have made those projects ready for human consumption I will be blogging and sharing what I find interesting on my journey, as I learn new frameworks and ways of thinking about data but right now, you're going to have to contact me James.maine92(at)google's_email_service.com.

Cheers!

James
